todo:
profile scn_perf_test in pro trial?
"n" variables are redundant with array length property (change after merging stacking branch b/c won't enable many foreach loops)
don't necessarily decouple UnitSprite from paths
click & drag line
make delete other paths consider parents of units that made it
allow selecting any player, but giving commands only on human players
attack command & animations
don't allow attacking while moving for some units
repair building command
way to make multiple paths at a time
making new paths should select new ones as well?
don't make units come out in random directions?
allow selecting only 1 building at a time, and no units in addition?
deserialize scenario instead of loading 1 field at a time (would that shorten code by enough to make up for lost flexibility?)
sound
pathfinding
keep non-live paths in yellow areas w/o user help
darker gray tiles should act more conventionally
post to tigsource.com or unity forums?
rename to improbability?
unity 4.2
  text asset serialization
  quad primitive
    quad primitive doesn't display in player mode (output_log.txt says "The resource Quad.fbx could not be loaded from the resource file!")
  "Texture importer now has "Alpha is Transparency" setting, which does color dilation to fix edge artifacts on semitransparent textures. It is enabled by default for GUI textures."
  "fullscreen at native resolution" player setting"

improved delete other paths algorithm:
for each selected unit:
  for each parent of this unit:
    for each child of parent:
      if child is a path and child isn't an ancestor of a selected unit:
        delete child (be careful of unit renumbering)

stacking data structures:
Node:
  long time
  int[] paths
  int[] units
  bool unseen
Path:
  Node[] nodes
  Move[] moves
  moved from Unit: tileX, tileY, timeSimPast

bool Path.removeUnit(time, unit):
get node at time
if unit not in node then return true
loop through previous nodes & connected paths until another child path w/ this unit is found
  may find multiple such nodes (if 2 branches split off children then joined into this node)
  if run into node initialized by scenario (no parent paths) then return false
for each parent node:
  do simulated remove, if fails then return false
for each parent node:
  removeUnitAfter(unit, parent node)

private bool Path.removeUnitAfter(unit, node):
if unit not in node then return true
if node is seen then return false
if no connected path contains unit just before node time:
  remove unit from each connected path containing unit just after node time
  remove units that can no longer be made using units at path intersection (consider effect on resources)
  if units in this node same as units in prev node and no units in connected paths can be made using or are the same as units in this path:
    delete node
    return removeUnitAfter(unit, node)
if not last node and !removeUnitAfter(unit, node + 1) then return false
remove unit from node
return true

rscCollected:
can use tree (not graph) approach most of the time, but be careful not to double count new units made b/c multiple units might be able to make it
1st calculate min or max rsc collected by each unit like usual, but also return child units made & their rsc collected
if duplicate child units made, subtract out their rsc collected from total

if ever allow "min" resources to be <0, must handle these cases w/o letting max resources ever be <0 in replays:
split worker into 2 paths, 1 path makes a mine, other path doesn't
make enough fighters that needs to have the mine to make them
if mine is seen:
  we're ok
if enough fighters are seen:
  delete path w/o mine
if path w/o mine is seen and enough fighters seen that 1 more would require the mine:
  for every unseen unit:
    if seeing this unit would ever make resources negative (even if it becomes positive by the present time), delete this unit

fancy resources algorithm (allow min < 0) draft:
(bug: allows resources to be negative in past as long as it becomes positive by present)
for each unit w/ no child units:
  if playerResource(max except skipping this unit) - unit.rscCollected(no min or max since no child units) < 0:
    delete unit
    do this calculation on unit's parent
def playerResource(skipUnit):
  if skipUnit is child path:
    take paths to get there, but don't add resources collected by skipUnit
  else:
    take paths to get there, but set ret = 0 instead of ret = pathCollected

pathfinding:
tile-based fog of war good?
find disconnected regions
path smoothing
would graph be too big?

other questions:
puzzle brainstorming

changing the past and wavefunctions levels:
- what they didn't see
  - Matthew's 3/17/2013 email has alternate idea for 1st level
- better than a coin flip
- spreading coherence (objective is to see the entire map)
  - user controls electrons, but some antiprotons on map
  - after level introduce find enemy command to automate this in future
  - in q&a explain how nature controls/sees everything (1 player game) & how we measure it, interpretations of quantum mechanics
- retroactive coherence
- do I need another level to show applications of switching particles, or does 1st level show this well enough?
- somehow show how particle can be "coherent" even if not in yellow region
- make levels introducing economic parts of game after making sure they play well in multiplayer
...
- qubits? (might not need this level)
- lucky number computing
  - must introduce "waking up" concept before this level
- CPT level to annihilate the antiproton in negative 10 seconds (only enable CPT button for this level)
- thinking in the present
  - put introduction text in "what they didn't see" repeat
  - initially show detailed animation for each move command, then short animation retracing particle's movement every time after that

paths levels: (find better synonym for "part 2" such as redux?)
- better than a coin flip, part 2
- spreading coherence, part 2
- retroactive coherence, part 2
- defend 10 towers, 1 tower will be attacked (or enemy king will come out 1 of them), have 1 healthy marine & 9 unhealthy marines, win w/o losing a single unit (by sharing paths)
  - may not work as is, could just move healthy marine along multiple paths
- snipers

random notes:
- form 2 paths of same unit, then stack those paths is example of why merging paths must be handled directly (justifying stacking branch)
- phrase from AI wisdom: "expand selection by radius"
- only share paths if option is checked for a selection of units (don't want units randomly disappearing out of nowhere)
  - if some wavefunctions don't overlap yet, send paths going between those units
- make paths with same parent unit(s) pulse in phase with each other as excuse to say they're coherent (if not in a quantum way)
  - if multiple parent units share some but not all paths with each other, show superposition of their pulsing (maybe with offset positions so it's clearer they're separate)
  - pulse parent units at different frequencies? (faster pulsing can be done with lower amplitude b/c more noticeable)
  - pulse wavefunctions (in different colors for different parent units?) so can say they're coherent too?
- retroactive visibility assumes units don't discontinuously disappear, so would require that paths move into another unit before being deleted (e.g. when another path of same unit is seen)
- when adding saved replays, maybe add timeSim field to Unit.Move (but this doesn't help with tiles)
- tile coherence can be optimized in short term by only calculating it when unit moves onto the tile
  - if happening in present, only need to check that other players can't see the tile
- someone recommends binary space partitioning as general graphics optimizing technique
- population limit? (or just make units expensive enough that you can't make too many)
- company of heroes makes positioning important b/c resource gathering slow, low unit cap, controlling resource locations is important
- introduce paths 1st, then introduce wavefunctions as paths going everywhere in a region? (skipping manual time travel)
  - but manual time travel is nice though
  - keep in mind hard to force using time travel in levels if can use paths
- Matthew says have story or something to make game interesting for people not interested in "physics" q&a's
- unit type ideas (Matthew says using real life particles is bad idea)
  - don't need too many unit types b/c time travel & paths already make the game interesting
  - can have ranged units with visible laser paths
    - except can only see own snipers' laser paths (from all possible snipers)
    - other units' range is less than vis radius, so would have decohered by the time they shoot (so ok for anyone to see laser path)
  - have few increments of health, so easier to switch with someone with same health
    - having a healer unit also makes switching units easier
  - can't have mines (they'd have to be visible to the opponent when in seeing range)
  - sniper unit that shoots further than visibility range (but can shoot units that other units see)
    - which sniper shot it?
    - reload slowly so not too powerful?
    - have option to change into different unit type if seen by another player, so using multiple paths doesn't just make snipers easier to find
  - Matthew's unit images can be pixellated to keep them simple
  - workers/miners with low/0 attack (use as "helpers" in levels)
    - make more interesting name for them?
  - marines (generic shooting unit)
