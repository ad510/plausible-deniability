1/26/2014, commit f030824
- more complete tutorial (mine on mineral to collect rsc different from usual)
- don't show path buttons in tutorial (though wasn't an issue with this player)
- find the datacenter
  - might not be obvious what objective is (I told him explicitly)
  - hint to press "new path"
  - formation buttons
  - not clear relationship between "they see" & "you see"
    - who is they?
    - he suggests showing side by side instead of buttons
    - didn't figure out seen one is one they see
  - show objective text all throughout replay, not just when directly seen
  - didn't see time slider
  - previously had bug where sometimes all datacenters would be deleted (but last one not from history)
- he didn't suspect anything :)
