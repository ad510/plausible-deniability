3/2/2014, commit ebda5a8
- camera controls
- tour guide text sometimes off screen
- some people don't figure out that new paths are selectable (solution is automatically select the new paths)
- hard to notice when tour guide dies
- he beat the infiltration by brute force :(
- is ring formation useful?
- resource calculation bug still exists

1/26/2014, commit f030824
- more complete tutorial (mine on mineral to collect rsc different from usual)
- initially keep tour guide in sight of player's unit
x cost tooltips
x don't show path buttons in tutorial (though wasn't an issue with this player)
- find the datacenter
  x might not be obvious what objective is (I told him explicitly)
  - hint to press "new path"
  x formation buttons
  x not clear relationship between "they see" & "you see"
    - who is they?
    - he suggests showing side by side instead of buttons
    - didn't figure out seen one is one they see
  x show objective text all throughout replay, not just when directly seen
  - didn't see time slider
  x previously had bug where sometimes all datacenters would be deleted (but last one not from history)
- he didn't suspect anything :)
